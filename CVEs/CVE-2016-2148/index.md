A DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) client is a device or software application that requests and receives network configuration information from a DHCP server.

When a device connects to a network, it typically needs to obtain an IP address, subnet mask, default gateway and other network settings in order to communicate with other devices on the network and access the internet. Instead of manually configuring these settings, a DHCP client can send a request to a DHCP server(mostly your home router if you are at your home network), which will assign an available IP address and provide other necessary network configuration information.

udhcpc(Micro DHCP Client), is a lightweight DHCP client implementation for embedded Linux systems,routers and other networking devices where limited resources make it impractical to use a full-featured DHCP client.

**This vulnerability, CVE-2016-2148, affects the DHCP Client,udhcpc,in older versions of BusyBox.**

## What is BusyBox BTW...
It is a software suite that provides a set of Unix-like command-line utilities in a single executable file. It is often used in embedded Linux systems and other resource-constrained devices, where a full-fledged operating system may be impractical due to limitedresources. While BusyBox is not an operating system in itself, it is often used as part of a larger system, such as an embedded Linux distribution, to provide essential command-line utilities in a compact and resource-efficient package.

Specifically, this vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow (Heap BufferOverflow) in the option handling code of udhcpc. An attacker who can control a DHCP server(a router for example), that a vulnerable udhcpc client connects to, can send a DHCP response with a malicious option value that triggers the buffer overflow and allows arbitrary code execution or even DoS.

When the DHCP client(udhcpc) in BusyBox parses certain options related to IPv6 Rapid Deployment (6rd), it may not allocate enough memory to store the received data. An attacker could exploit this by sending a packet with a large value in the "DATA_LEN" field of the "OPTION_6RD" option. This would cause the client to allocate an insufficient buffer and write beyond its boundaries, overwriting other data on the heap and potentially executing arbitrary code.
