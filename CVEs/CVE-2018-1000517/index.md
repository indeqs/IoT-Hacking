CVE-2018-1000517 is a buffer overflow (Heap BufferOverflow) vulnerability that affects the `wget` utility in older versions of BusyBox. The vulnerability occurs when the `wget` utility is used to download a file from a remote server and the length of the HTTP response exceeds the size of the buffer allocated for storing the response. This can cause the response data to overflow the buffer and potentially overwrite adjacent memory areas, leading to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution.

An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious HTTP server or by intercepting traffic between a legitimate HTTP server and a vulnerable wget client. By sending a specially crafted HTTP response, the attacker could trigger the buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system with the privileges of the user running `wget`.

**This attack is exploitable over a network**
